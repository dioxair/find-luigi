## An online version of the "Wanted!" minigame from Super Mario 64 DS, inspired by the @FindLuigi Twitter account

This is currently a very bare-bones implementation of the minigame. I'll probably add more stuff in the future to make this more fun.

## TO-DO LIST:
- Add one of those info icons with a cool popup to explain some settings
- Add a setting for shuffling layers of characters
- ~~Migrate project to using Node.js and Typescript~~
